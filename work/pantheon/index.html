            Although it can’t scale forever, we are hardly using a fifth of its
            total capacity. When we eventually reach this threshold, we could
            potentially pay for SSO capabilities for the essential services we
            rely on. Until then, we decided to build Pantheon around Google
            Workspace.
            <span class="highlight"
              >This concept is simple: accept students, upload their information
              to Workspace (and issue then @developforgood.org emails), monitor
              the email allocations, and delete them at the end of each cycle to
              free up space in Workspace.</span

            We constructed an
            <span class="highlight"

            We then integrated various functionalities into different view
            types, each tailored to specific internal classifications. For
            instance, user views enable the export of users to Workspace. With
            this dashboard,
            <span class="highlight">crafted with TypeScript and React</span>,
            our executives can log in, generate custom views pulling data from
            Airtable, and export users. We also utilized

            aesthetically pleasing UI that user-friendliness, intuitiveness, and

          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>
            We used Rust for our backend.
            <span class="highlight"
              >Our goal was to build a maintainable codebase</span
            >
            which would compile to a small binary that could be easily deployed
            on a server or Kubernetes cluster, and horizontally scaled. Drawing
            from past experiences, we ruled out Go (over Rust) due to previous
            challenges. We used
            <span class="highlight">Axum as our backend web framework</span>
            because it is lightweight and had excellent mechanisms for
            dependency injection.
            <span class="highlight"
              >In selecting our database and cache solutions, we settled on
              PostgreSQL and Redis respectively</span
            >
            as they are battle-tested technologies that were well-suited for our
            requirements. PostgreSQL is used to store views, keep track of
            exported users, and manage data regarding asynchronous jobs, such as
            export and import tasks.
            <span class="highlight"
              >During development, we utilize Docker to spin up a database,
              while for production, we use an RDS t1.medium instance on AWS that
              fits our needs nicely.</span
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <!-- challenges -->
        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <!-- rate limits -->
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i>Rate Limits</h4>
            <p>
              Airtable’s API imposes a
              <span class="highlight"
                >maximum of 5 requests per second and returns only 100 records
                per request when fetching data.</span
              >
              To circumvent these limitations without causing our API endpoint
              to block, we did three things. Firstly, we
              <span class="highlight"
                >built a framework for asynchronous, cancellable tasks.</span
              >
              Upon receiving a request, we return and initiate an asynchronous
              job. Job metadata is stored in PostgreSQL, and in the Pantheon UI,
              a window displays information about jobs associated with the view,
              categorized as complete, pending, error, or canceled.
            </p>

            <p>
              This approach was
              <span class="highlight"
                >powered by Tokio’s task functionality.</span
              >
              Tokio is the asynchronous runtime we chose for our API and has the
              capability to run blocking tasks on a separate thread pool so as
              to not block the API. This solution
              <span class="highlight"
                >ensures our API remains non-blocking</span
              >
              while managing rate limits by launching tasks with artificial
              delays and retry mechanisms as needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Second, we lazily loaded the views.</span>
              Rather than loading all the data at once, we waited until it was
              requested by a team member.
              <span class="highlight"
                >Lastly, (and most importantly), we created a server-less
                function on AWS Lambda</span
              >
              which is called by an Airtable automation we set up as a
              JavaScript script.
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- caching -->
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i>Caching</h4>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight"
                >Requests to Airtable often took considerable time (5 - 15
                seconds), causing the UI to feel sluggish.</span
              >
              Moreover, concerns about stale data persisted as new volunteers
              were added and accepted at DFG over time, which would invalidate
              the cache.
              <span class="highlight"
                >To address this, we used our asynchronous job framework to
                schedule periodic data refreshes every few hours, with a manual
                refresh button in the UI for immediate updates.</span
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              This solution, although not perfect, allows our management team to
              ensure data accuracy by triggering a refetch when necessary, with
              a cooldown mechanism in place to prevent hitting rate limits.
              <span class="highlight"
                >Thus far, this approach has proven effective, given our modest
                management team size and infrequent data synchronization
                issues.</span
