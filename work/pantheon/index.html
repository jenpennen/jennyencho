              Develop For Good currently operates without a dedicated cloud
              environment for its services, resulting in user fragmentation.
              This limitation makes it difficult to securely manage and protect

            <p>
              The onboarding and offboarding processes at Develop For Good is

          <p>
            DFG’s partnership with Okta for Good provided access to a powerful
            tool:
            <span class="text-pink-600">Okta Workforce Federation.</span> The
            workflow was simple—volunteers accepted into a project cycle were
            added to an Airtable sheet, triggering a Lambda function to create
            their profiles in Okta’s universal directory.
            <span class="text-pink-600"
              >However, this approach hit a roadblock when we discovered that
              Single Sign-On (SSO) integration required enterprise-level
              subscriptions for platforms like Slack, Figma, and Notion.</span
            >
            Despite having paid business and pro plans, we lacked the resources

            Only product leads and management members are issued Develop for
            Good handles (@developforgood.org). However, the Google for
            Nonprofits plan allows up to 2,000 users. While this capacity isn’t
            unlimited, we’re hardly using a fifth of its limit. When we do reach
            this limit, paying for SSO capabilities for essential services may
            become feasible. In the meantime, we chose to build Pantheon around
            Google Workspace.
            <span class="text-pink-600"
              >The process is straightforward: accept students, upload their

            </h4>
            <p>
              Airtable’s API enforces a maximum of 5 requests per second and
              returns only 100 records per request, which posed challenges when
              fetching large datasets.
              <span class="text-pink-600"
                >To address these limitations without blocking our API, we
                implemented a four-pronged solution:
              </span>
              an asynchronous task framework powered by Tokio to handle
              non-blocking, cancellable tasks displayed on the UI; lazy loading
              to fetch data only when requested; and a serverless AWS Lambda
              function triggered by an Airtable automation script to streamline
              processing.
            </p>

          <!-- caching -->
          <div class="py-3">
            <h4 class="font-semibold uppercase pb-2"># Caching</h4>
            <p>
              Requests to Airtable often took 5–15 seconds, causing sluggish UI
              performance and raising concerns about stale data as new
              volunteers joined.
              <span class="text-pink-600"
                >To address this, we used our asynchronous job framework to
                schedule periodic data refreshes every few hours and added a
                manual refresh button in the UI for immediate updates.</span
              >
              This approach, combined with a cooldown mechanism to avoid rate
              limits has proven effective, given our modest management team size

            Focusing on Pantheon’s management interface, I mapped out the user
            journey. With every iteration, I incorporated feedback from DFG’s
            executive team and my team to improve the user experience, creating
            new features along the way.

            <p>
              Pantheon's technical architecture changed multiple times across
              iterations. In each technical iteration, I saw firsthand how
              crucial good and functional design is to make complex technical
              systems accessible to everyday users. It was a thrill to translate
              complex data structures into user-friendly layouts, and it's
              reinforced my commitment to continue building upon both my design
              and technical skills.

          <div class="py-3">
            <h4 class="font-semibold"># Understand the big picture first.</h4>
            <p>
              Pantheon required extensive discussions of abstract concepts and
              potential tech stacks before initiating the UX/UI design process.
              Along the way, I gained a deeper understanding of how clean code
              design directly influences effective user interface design. These
              discussions pushed me to thoughtfully conceptualize how data
              should be presented to users in a clear, uncomplicated manner.
              Without this comprehensive approach to analyzing the big picture,
              Pantheon would not have achieved its current level of usability
              and impact today.
