            Tugo (formerly Retune) is a mobile application designed to answer
            that curiosity by making music-sharing with others more transparent
            and social.

            This project began in October 2021 as part of UCLA DevX. Formerly
            named Retune, I joined a team of 6 engineers as a UI/UX designer and
            developer. As Retune came to an end in 2024, I continued working on
            this project, renaming it Tugo. I formed a new team of two alongside
            fellow developer and colleague Nastazia Coronado.

              Students want to socialize with other students before honing in
              for the academic year. However, connecting with new people in a

              Inspired by a popular tiktok trend, where influencers ask nearby

            share music with people nearby.

            Creating a style guide was a challenging but essential step before
            diving into high-fidelity designs. I identified many inconsistencies
            in key design components from Retune. I developed a UI style guide
            to ensure that components were styled consistently throughout the
            app. Inspired by the blue summer skies of Los Angeles, this style
            guide was intended to reflect that aesthetic.

            <p>
              While participants appreciated the public and private viewing
              options with the close friends and public maps, I identified a
              significant UX flaw:
              <span class="text-blue-600"
                >these options should apply to the user, not the map. A striking
                60% of the participants chose the close friends map over the
                public map, and nearly half expressed no preference.</span
              >
              There was essentially no functional difference between the two
              maps. Instead of two maps, I introduced a feature in the user’s
              profile settings that allows users to selectively share personal
              information with the public.

              Moreover, the profile view of other Tugo users, along with their
              profile handles, made it difficult to access the play button. This
              led me to conclude that it is better to keep all users’
              information hidden during the song shuffling process to preserve
              the focus on music exploration and discovery.

              One key feature my Retune team developed was the user music tab,
              which displays a user’s current song, favorite albums, and
              artists. However,
              <span class="text-blue-600"

                too cluttered and hindered their discovery experience.</span
              >
              To address this, I streamlined the music tab to focus on song
              shuffling and added a profile view for detailed music activity.

            When a user clicks on a vinyl icon on the map, another user’s
            current song appears on the song tab, which can be expanded to show
            other recently played songs from the user. Users can also shuffle
            through nearby songs via the shuffle icon, enabling music discovery
            while maintaining privacy.

            From usability testing from the design team to the marketing team
            that helped bring Tugo widespread to the UCLA campus, Tugo has
            helped 200+ students discover and engage with new music from artists
            they did not know.
            <span class="text-blue-600"
              >As of May 2024, our top priority is to build Tugo with new
              designs in consideration.</span

            <p>
              After two years of using the same tools at Retune, I started
              looking for ways to improve my workflow. I dove into Figma's new
              features, like their prototyping tools, to make my designs even
              better. On the tech side, I started exploring new frameworks and
              libraries to make Tugo's code cleaner and more efficient.
              <span class="text-blue-600"
                >This whole process of trying new things helped me come up with
                some cool new ideas for Tugo and gave me a stronger sense of
                ownership over the project.</span

            <p>
              Leading the design and development of a project for the UCLA
              community was extremely rewarding, and I'm excited to bring that
              energy to Tugo. With Tugo, I'm making sure design is a top
              priority in every step of the process. Plus,
