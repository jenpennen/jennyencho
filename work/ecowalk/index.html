          <h3>Proposal</h3>
          <p>
            In many American cities, relying on cars for travel is often
            unavoidable and an essential part of peopleâ€™s daily routines.
            <span class="highlight"
              >This raises an important question: how can we foster new,
              positive habits through our transportation choices?</span
            >
            Whether it's increasing walking or improving sleep routines,
            building habits requires consistent practice. To address this
            challenge effectively, we needed to delve deeper into people's needs
            and frustrations with their current transportation options.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
          <p>
            My next focus was to gather perspectives on transportation needs
            from those around me.
            <span class="highlight"
              >I reached out to my local community to understand how their daily
              routines are impacted by transportation.</span

            Additionally, with the help of my team members, I extended this
            outreach to major cities beyond Los Angeles to collect a wide range
            of insights.

          <p>
            Given the responses of +60 interviewees, I used an empathy map to
            distinguish frustration patterns. This approach revealed several key
            points of frustration:
            <span class="highlight"
              >convenience, time, and personal motivation.</span

              >
              By choosing to forgo one convenience-driven habit each dayâ€”such as
              avoiding overnight phone charging or walking to nearby

              By setting incremental goals to incorporate a healthy habit into

          <p class="extra-spacing">
            At the end of the 10 weeks, my team and I presented EcoWalk to a
            group of engineers and technology professionals in collaboration
            with Dandilyonn. The idea was met with great enthusiasm, and we also
            received valuable feedback.

          <h3>Feedback</h3>

            <h4>
              <i class="fa-solid fa-map"></i>Account for the geographical
              constraints of the user's location
            </h4>
            <p>
              During the ideation process, we overlooked the fact that
              <span class="highlight"
                >not everyone lives in a walkable area</span
              >, which significantly influences the reliance on cars. Dandilyonn
              engineers suggested that, rather than focusing solely on physical
              activity,
              <span class="highlight"
                >we should expand the app to include other eco-friendly
                transportation options</span
              >
              like scooters and trains.

              <span class="highlight"
                >our team faced an unexpected setback.</span
              >
              Our team's designer had to leave the internship due to unforeseen
              circumstances, leaving us uncertain about how to handle the design
              work. This marked my first exposure to UI/UX design, and I took
              extra time during the internship to learn about best practices in
              the field. Although this wasn't how I had envisioned my summer, I
              thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and it ignited a passion that
              shaped the rest of my college years, driving my focus on design
              and tech-centered products!

            <p>
              <span class="highlight"
                >One challenge I encountered during this internship was
                effectively communicating my ideas and work to my team
                members</span
              >. When we found ourselves facing a tight deadline midway through
              the internship, we made it a priority to regularly update each
              other on our progress in both code and design. This open
              communication was crucial in bringing EcoWalk to life. This
              experience taught me that without consistent and clear
              communication, tasks can stall, and innovative ideas might never
              come to fruition.
