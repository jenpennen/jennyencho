            from students and organizations seeking technical opportunities and
            digital services. However, the organization has struggled to scale

          <p>
            DFG’s partnership with Okta for Good provided access to a powerful
            tool: <span class="highlight">Okta Workforce Federation.</span> The
            workflow was simple—volunteers accepted into a project cycle were
            added to an Airtable sheet, triggering a Lambda function to create
            their profiles in Okta’s universal directory.
            <span class="highlight"
              >However, this approach hit a roadblock when we discovered that
              Single Sign-On (SSO) integration required enterprise-level
              subscriptions for platforms like Slack, Figma, and Notion.</span
            >
            Despite having paid business and pro plans, we lacked the resources

            Nonprofits plan allows up to 2,000 users. While this capacity isn’t
            unlimited, we’re hardly using a fifth of its limit. When we do reach
            this limit, paying for SSO capabilities for essential services may
            become feasible. In the meantime, we chose to build Pantheon around
            Google Workspace.
            <span class="highlight"

            Our foundation was built on Airtable. To streamline executive acess

            Airtable and Google Workspace. Since no existing solutions fit our
            needs, we designed a custom solution that tailored to our workflow.

            <p>
              Airtable’s API enforces a maximum of 5 requests per second and
              returns only 100 records per request, which posed challenges when
              fetching large datasets.
              <span class="highlight"
                >To address these limitations without blocking our API, we
                implemented a four-pronged solution:
              </span>
              an asynchronous task framework powered by Tokio to handle
              non-blocking, cancellable tasks displayed on the UI; lazy loading
              to fetch data only when requested; and a serverless AWS Lambda
              function triggered by an Airtable automation script to streamline
              processing.

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i>Caching</h4>
            <p>
              Requests to Airtable often took 5–15 seconds, causing sluggish UI
              performance and raising concerns about stale data as new
              volunteers joined.
              <span class="highlight"
                >To address this, we used our asynchronous job framework to

              This approach, combined with a cooldown mechanism to avoid rate

            The first Pantheon MVP was unveiled at Okta For Good’s fellowship
            convention in April 2024. Presented to an audience of hundreds, this
            showcase provided a valuable opportunity to gather feedback, explore
            potential improvements to Pantheon’s technical infrastructure, and
            refine our designs accordingly.

              specific internal classification.

              These exports and imports are displayed to the right of the
              dashboard, categorized by status: complete, pending, error, or
              cancelled.

            <p>
              As Pantheon’s tech architecture and constraints evolved, so did
              the design. One notable change was in how Airtable data was
              extracted to Pantheon. With these changes, we were back to square
              one, starting with new dashboard layout sketches.

                display a single internal classification. To optimize efficiency
                and functionality, I sketched out a multi-classification
                approach for a comprehensive look within a single dashboard.

            DFG management can create dashboards that provide a comprehensive

            Airtable, offer insights into volunteer and client data, data
            fetching status, and key performance metrics.

              Pantheon has been the most intricate technical architecture I’ve
              worked on to date (as of October 2024). Its evolution through
              multiple architectural changes has given me invaluable lessons on
              the importance of functional design to make complex technical
              systems accessible to everyday users. Combining my background in
              both tech and design to bring a scalable product to life has been
              an exciting challenge and reinforced my commitment to continuously
              update my technical skills alongside design skills.

            <p>
              Pantheon required extensive discussions of abstract concepts and
              potential tech stacks before initiating the UX/UI design process.
              Along the way, I gained a deeper understanding of how clean code
              design directly influences effective user interface design. These
              discussions pushed me to thoughtfully conceptualize how data
              should be presented to users in a clear, uncomplicated manner.
              Without this comprehensive approach to analyzing the big picture,
              Pantheon would not have achieved its current level of usability
              and impact today.
