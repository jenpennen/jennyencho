            This project began in October 2021 as part of UCLA DevX's 2021 Fall
            Project Cycle. Originially named Retune,
            <span class="highlight"

            I collaborated with 1 fellow designer Emily, 3 frontend developers
            (Angelina, Leslie, Liah), 2 backend developers (Nathan, Sanya), and
            product manager (Jake).

              working on this project, renaming it Tugo.</span
            >
            I formed a new team of two alongside fellow developer and colleague
            Nastazia Coronado.

            First, I conducted an analysis on four existing music platforms â€”

            I reached out to the UCLA community first to understand students'
            music-listening preferences. Additionally, I reached out to students
            outside of UCLA, as well as non-students, to hear as many diverse
            perspectives possible.

              significant UX flaw:
              <span class="highlight"
                >these options should apply to the user, not the map.</span
              >
              A striking 60% of the participants chose the close friends map
              over the public map, and nearly half expressed no preference.
              <span class="highlight"
                >Instead of two maps, I introduced a feature in the userâ€™s
                profile settings that allows users to selectively share personal
                information with the public.</span

              Many participants noted that the follow button
              <span class="highlight"
                >felt out of place, making the app feel more like a social
                network than a music discovery platform.
              </span>
              Moreover, the profile view of other Tugo users, along with their
              profile handles, made it difficult to access the play button and
              gave the cluttered appearance.

              One key feature my Retune team developed was the user music tab,
              which displays a userâ€™s current song, favorite albums, and
              artists. However, only 20% of participants fully explored it, and
              <span class="highlight"
                >80% found it too cluttered and hindered their discovery
                experience.</span
              >
              To address this, I streamlined the music tab to focus on song
              shuffling and added a profile view for detailed music activity.

          <h3>Outcomes</h3>
          <p>
            Since its inception, Tugo has reached the hearts and earbuds of the
            UCLA community. From usability testing from the design team to the
            marketing team that helped bring Tugo widespread to the UCLA campus,
            <span class="highlight"
              >Tugo has helped 200+ students discover and engage with new music
              from artists they did not know.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            As of May 2024, our top priority is to build Tugo with new designs
            in consideration.

            <p>
              This project stressed the importance of staying current in design
              and tech. Redesigning features was challenging, but my background
              in software development and design helped me quickly adapt. On the
              design side, I incorporated Figmaâ€™s new prototyping and dev tools
              into my design workflow. On the tech side, I discovered frameworks
              and libraries that can enhance Tugoâ€™s codebase.

            <p>
              Leading the UI/UX design and frontend development of a project
              made for the UCLA community was incredibly fulfilling, and Iâ€™m
              eager to carry this momentum forward with Tugo. In this new
              venture, Iâ€™m ensuring design considerations are integrated into
              every engineering decision and ultimately, foster a learning
              environment for new technologies and workflows for myself and my
              Tugo partner Azia.
