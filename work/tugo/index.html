              This project began in October 2021 as part of UCLA DevX's 2021
              Fall Project Cycle. Originially named Retune,
              <span class="highlight"
                >I joined the team as a founding UI/UX designer and
                developer.</span
              >
              I collaborated with 1 fellow designer Emily, 3 frontend developers
              (Angelina, Leslie, Liah), 2 backend developers (Nathan, Sanya),
              and product manager (Jake).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight"
                >Ultimately, as Retune came to an end, I decided to continue
                working on this project, renaming it Tugo.</span
              >
              I formed a new team of two alongside fellow developer and
              colleague

            Retune was inspired by a common user curiosity:
            <span class="highlight"
              >"What songs are the people around me listening to?"</span
            >
            My team and I saw the opportunity to transform this question into a
            unique music discovery experience for the UCLA community, where
            students can easily view the songs other students are currently
            listening to.
            <span class="highlight"

            First, I conducted an analysis on four existing music platforms â€”

            >
            I reached out to the UCLA community first to understand students'
            music-listening preferences. Additionally, I reached out to students
            outside of UCLA, as well as non-students, to hear as many diverse
            perspectives possible.

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <p class="subsubcontainer">
              Creating a style guide was a challenging but essential step before
              diving into high-fidelity designs. I identified many
              inconsistencies in key design components from Retune. I developed
              a UI style guide to ensure that components were styled
              consistently throughout the app.

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p class="subsubcontainer">
            Starting with the old Retune designs, I created a working prototype
            and <span class="highlight">recruited 20 participants</span> to test
            it. I decided to use Figma's prototype feature due to the cost of
            our other option, Maze. While Figma had some limitations compared to
            Maze,

              Instead of two maps, I introduced a feature in the user's profile

              Many participants noted that the follow button

              Moreover, the profile view of other Tugo users, along with their
              profile handles, made it difficult to access the play button and
              gave the cluttered appearance.

            <p>
              One key feature my Retune team developed was the user music tab,
              which displays a userâ€™s current song, favorite albums, and
              artists. However,
              <span class="highlight"
                >only 20% of participants fully explored it, and 80% found it
                too cluttered</span
              >, hindering their discovery experience. To address this,
              <span class="highlight"
                >I streamlined the music tab to focus on song shuffling</span
              >
              and added a profile view for detailed music activity.
            </p>

            <p class="extra-spacing">
              This led me to conclude that
              <span class="highlight"
                >it is better to keep all users' information hidden</span
              >

              <span class="highlight"
                >preserve the focus on music exploration and discovery</span

          <p>
            Since its inception, Tugo has reached the hearts and earbuds of the
            UCLA community. From usability testing from the design team to the
            marketing team that helped bring Tugo widespread to the UCLA campus,
            <span class="highlight"
              >Tugo has helped 200+ students discover and engage with new music
              from artists they did not know.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            As of May 2024, our top priority is to build Tugo with new designs
            in consideration.

              This project truly emphasized the importance of staying current in

              a rewarding experience. Revamping this project as Tugo with a team
              I builtâ€”just as my product manager did with Retuneâ€”has been an
              exciting new path. With this shift, Iâ€™m
