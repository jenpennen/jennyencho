            I joined Develop For Good as a software engineer in March 2023.
            Alongside fellow engineer Anish Sinha, we identified a critical need
            for a dedicated cloud infrastructure to support DFG’s growing demand
            among students and nonprofits. In August 2023, we proposed a series
            of Cloud and AI initiatives to DFG Founder Mary Zhu, which
            ultimately led to the creation of Pantheon. As a founding designer
            and engineer, I spearheaded the design strategy and frontend
            engineering for DFG’s internal services, and continue to work on
            Pantheon to this date.

            Despite our paid business and pro plans, we lack the resources for

            Currently, the only volunteers issued Develop for Good handles

            Although it can’t scale forever, we are hardly using a fifth of its
            total capacity. When we eventually reach this threshold, we could
            potentially pay for SSO capabilities for the essential services we
            rely on. Until then, we decided to build Pantheon around Google
            Workspace.
            <span class="highlight"
              >This concept is simple: accept students, upload their information
              to Workspace (and issue them @developforgood.org emails), monitor
              the email allocations, and delete them at the end of each cycle to
              free up space in Workspace.</span

          <p>
            This streamlined approach not only
            <span class="highlight"
              >manages user accounts and their life cycles</span
            >, but
            <span class="highlight"
              >also ensures controlled access to services since every service we
              rely on has complimentary SSO for Google.

            We then integrated various functionalities into different view

          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>
            We used Rust for our backend.
            <span class="highlight"
              >Our goal was to build a maintainable codebase</span
            >
            which would compile to a small binary that could be easily deployed
            on a server or Kubernetes cluster, and horizontally scaled. Drawing
            from past experiences, we ruled out Go (over Rust) due to previous
            challenges. We used
            <span class="highlight">Axum as our backend web framework</span>
            because it is lightweight and had excellent mechanisms for
            dependency injection.
            <span class="highlight"
              >In selecting our database and cache solutions, we settled on
              PostgreSQL and Redis respectively</span
            >
            as they are battle-tested technologies that were well-suited for our
            requirements. PostgreSQL is used to store views, keep track of
            exported users, and manage data regarding asynchronous jobs, such as
            export and import tasks.
            <span class="highlight"
              >During development, we utilize Docker to spin up a database,
              while for production, we use an RDS t1.medium instance on AWS that
              fits our needs nicely.</span
            >

        <!-- challenges -->

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <!-- rate limits -->
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i>Rate Limits</h4>
            <p>
              Airtable’s API imposes a maximum of 5 requests per second and
              returns only 100 records per request when fetching data.
              <span class="highlight"
                >To circumvent these limitations without causing our API
                endpoint to block, we did three things.</span
              >
              Firstly, we built a framework for asynchronous, cancellable tasks.
              Upon receiving a request, we return and initiate an asynchronous
              job. Job metadata is stored in PostgreSQL, and in the Pantheon UI,
              a window displays information about jobs associated with the view,
              categorized as complete, pending, error, or canceled.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="highlight"
                >This approach was powered by Tokio’s task functionality.</span
              >
              Tokio is the asynchronous runtime we chose for our API and has the
              capability to run blocking tasks on a separate thread pool so as
              to not block the API. This solution
              <span class="highlight"
                >ensures our API remains non-blocking while managing rate
                limits</span
              >
              by launching tasks with artificial delays and retry mechanisms as
              needed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <span class="highlight">Second, we lazily loaded the views.</span>
              Rather than loading all the data at once, we waited until it was
              requested by a team member.
              <span class="highlight"
                >Lastly, (and most importantly), we created a server-less
                function on AWS Lambda</span
              >
              which is called by an Airtable automation we set up as a
              JavaScript script.
            </p>
          </div>
          <!-- caching -->
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h4><i class="fa-solid fa-robot"></i>Caching</h4>
            <p>
              Requests to Airtable often took considerable time (5 - 15
              seconds), causing the UI to feel sluggish. Moreover, concerns
              about stale data persisted as new volunteers were added and
              accepted at DFG over time, which would invalidate the cache.
              <span class="highlight"
                >To address this, we used our asynchronous job framework to
                schedule periodic data refreshes every few hours, with a manual
                refresh button in the UI for immediate updates.</span
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              This solution, although not perfect, allows our management team to
              ensure data accuracy by triggering a refetch when necessary, with
              a cooldown mechanism in place to prevent hitting rate limits. Thus
              far, this approach has proven effective, given our modest
              management team size and infrequent data synchronization issues.

            Since the inception of this project, Develop For Good has recieved
            over $1 million in funding in support of Pantheon's development
            through key partnerships with Stanford's StartX and Okta. In
            November of 2023, Develop For Good became the first nonprofit to be
            accepted to Stanford's startup accelerator StartX, with Pantheon
            highlighting DFG as a tech nonprofit startup and partnered with Okta
            For Good. As of October 2024, Pantheon's work is featured on Okta's
            tech blog community and has officially launched for every team in
            the Winter 2025 cycle and beyond.
