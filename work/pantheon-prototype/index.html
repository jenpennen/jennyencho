         A written report on the first Pantheon prototype

          <!-- background --> 
          <p>In recent years, Develop For Good (DFG),
            has faced a growing interest from many students and nonprofit partners seeking
            technical opportunities and digital services. However, the possibility of
            scaling the organization was nonexistent. Since DFG was first established, the
            organization has relied on a manual onboarding/offboarding process, where DFG
            Program Director Amanda Lo personally invites each accepted volunteer and
            nonprofit to the organizationâ€™s social platforms. This is a labor-intensive
            process that takes hours to complete, with each project cycle consisting of over
            250 volunteers and roughly 40 nonprofit partners. In addition to this
            time-consuming process, there were other technical issues within DFG that had to
            be considered at scale.</p>
        </div>

         <!-- User Frag + Data Confidentiality -->
        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h2 class="subheading">User Fragmentation and Data Confidentiality</h3>
          <p>
            Ensuring the secure removal of volunteers
            from DFG's social platforms after each project cycle is nearly impossible. Many
            student volunteers use personal or university email accounts to work on client
            projects, leaving any private client data shared during the cycle stored in
            those personal accounts. This creates significant risks for nonprofit partners,
            as such sensitive information could remain accessible to volunteers long after
            their involvement with them ends. Consequently, all DFG-specific project files
            are vulnerable to unauthorized access and sharing, jeopardizing the
            confidentiality of client and organization data. Combined with the current
            onboarding and offboarding process, which already takes hours to manage at DFG's
            existing scale, makes it virtually impossible for the organization to expand its
            services.

         <!-- Solution Proposal -->
        <div class="subcontainer">
          <h2 class=subheading>Solution Proposal</h2>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <p>To combat these existng issues, Anish and I provided a demo to DFG founder Mary
                Zhu on the promising potential of a modern identity and access management
                solution that can be integrated with many services used at DFG. In this demo, we
                used Penpot as an example application that can be integrated with Keycloak. The
                purpose of the demo was twofold:
            </p>
            <li>Highlight integration capabilities of Keycloak with other applications using
                the OpenID Connect protocol.</li>
            <li>The advantages of using Kubernetes for managing and scaling application
                infrastructure.</li>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h3>Keycloak</h3>
            <p>Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management platform developed by
                Red Hat. It provides robust security features that seamlessly integrates
                authentication and authorization mechanisms into applications and services. Used
                widely by many companies, such as Bosch and Deloitte, some key features of
                Keycloak include single sign-on (SSO), user federation, centralized management,
                and the admin console. All of these features will be essential for DFG's
                infrastructure as it scales.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h3>Penpot</h3>
            <p>Penpot, developed by Kaleidos Open Source, is an open-source design and
                prototyping tool, similar to Figma. Unlike other design tools, Penpot is
                web-based and platform-independent, and thus can be used on any operating
                system. Penpot is an excellent design tool for designers, making it a great
                example of an application that can be integrated with Keycloak in the future.</p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h3>Identity Management</h3>
            <p>
              Keycloak manages user identities, roles, and permissions. This would allow for
              secure access to applications and restrictions based on users' roles. Permisions
              can be placed to restrict access to applications exclusive to DFG's management
              members, volunteers, and clients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h3>Scalability</h3>
            <p>
              The scalability and flexibility of using Kubernetes to deploy and manage
              applications makes it possible to horizontally scale and seamlessly adapt to
              changing organizational needs.
            </p>

          <div class="subsubcontainer">
            <h3>Future Proofing Infrastructure</h3>
            <p>
              This setup can be future-proofed, making it easier for DFG to adapt and scale
              their infrastructure in response to envolving demands.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>
            DFG is a nonprofit organization that focuses on building new technology that
            allows for novel ways to serve their clients and student volunteers.
            Accordingly, it makes the most sense for DFG to provide these services with the
            most optimal environment possible.

            Following this demo, Anish and I joined Develop For Good as founding software
            engineers focusing on internal tools, notably Pantheon and PantheonAI. DFG has
            since evolved into a nonprofit tech startup, being the first nonprofit
            organization to be accepted to Stanford's startup accelerator StartX.
