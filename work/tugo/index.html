            <p>
              This project began in October 2021 as part of UCLA DevX's 2021
              Fall Project Cycle. Originially named Retune,
              <span class="highlight"
                >I joined the team as a founding UI/UX designer and
                developer.</span
              >
              I collaborated with 1 fellow designer Emily, 3 frontend developers
              (Angelina, Leslie, Liah), 2 backend developers (Nathan, Sanya),
              and product manager (Jake).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="highlight"
                >Ultimately, as Retune came to an end, I decided to continue
                working on this project, renaming it Tugo.</span
              >
              I formed a new team of two alongside fellow developer and friend
              <span class="inline">Nastazia Coronado</span>.

            <p>
              Students want to socialize with other students before honing in
              for the academic year. However,
              <span class="highlight"
                >connecting with new people in a large space, like UCLA, can be
                quite intimidating.</span

            <p>
              Inspired by a popular tiktok trend, where influencers ask nearby
              strollers in an area what song they were listening to,
              <span class="highlight"
                >I wondered if people around me were also naturally
                curious</span
              >
              about other peoples' whereabouts.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Based on these observations, my team and I envisioned Tugo (formerly
            Retune) as an app that would
            <span class="highlight"
              >enable students to stay informed about other students' music
              activities.</span
            >
            This app would allow users to see what others around them are
            listening to and explore a diverse mix of songs from those nearby.
            With this concept in mind, I initiated the research process.

            Starting with the old Retune designs, I created a working prototype
            and <span class="highlight">recruited 20 participants</span> to test
            it. I decided to use Figma's prototype feature due to the cost of
            our other option, Maze. While Figma had some limitations compared to
            Maze,

              Instead of two maps, I introduced a feature in the settings portal
              that allows users to selectively share personal information with
              the public.

              One key feature my Retune team developed was the user music tab,
              which displays a userâ€™s current song, favorite albums, and
              artists. However,
              <span class="highlight"
                >only 20% of participants fully explored it, and 80% found it
                too cluttered</span

              <span class="highlight"

              >

              necessary to maintain a pleasant viewing experience, and aspects I
              noticed were weak in key design elements from Retune. I developed
              a UI style guide to ensure that components were styled
              consistently throughout the app.

          <p>
            Tugo has undergone many changes since its inception both in design
            and technical toolkit. As Retune came to a close, I was determined
            to revamp this project from scratch. As of May 2024, our top
            priority is to build Tugo with new designs in consideration.

            <p>
              This project truly emphasized the importance of staying current in
              design and tech. Redesigning features was challenging, but my
              background in software development and design helped me quickly
              adapt, revealing the growing connection between the two fields.

              Tugo is headed in an exciting direction, and Iâ€™m eager to continue

            <p>
              My time at Retune was invaluable. Diving into UI/UX design and
              frontend development with a project serving the UCLA community was
              a rewarding experience, but
              <span class="highlight"
                >I often felt frustrated by the communication gap between the
                designers and engineers.</span
              >
              Since Retune was an engineering-heavy project, I found myself
              redesigning many features and UIs to match the engineering team's
              capabilities, even when they weren't the best design choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Revamping this project as Tugo with a team I builtâ€”just as my
              product manager did with Retuneâ€”has been an exciting new path.
              With this shift, Iâ€™m
              <span class="highlight"
                >giving design a voice in all engineering decisions</span
              >
              while giving myself and my project partner Azia the space to
              explore new technologies that enhance our engineering
              capabilities.
