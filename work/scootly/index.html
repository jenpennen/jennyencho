            This project started in September 2022 as part of UCLA's infamous CS

            <span class="highlight"

            Spending many nights coding to bring Scootly to life, we were united

            <p class="extra-spacing">
              Like many American cities, LA’s public transportation system falls
              short, leaving residents with

            <p>
              Budget-conscious people, especially college students, often face a
              tough choice:
              <span class="highlight"

                rentals?</span

              Neither option seems ideal—owning and maintaining a personal
              scooter is too time-consuming, while constantly paying for
              short-term rentals from companies like Bird and Uber quickly
              becomes expensive.

          <h3>Proposal</h3>
          <p>
            At UCLA, one thing is clear:
            <span class="highlight"
              >scooters are a campus staple and offer an unbeatable
              convenience</span
            >
            for getting around. For many students, scooters even
            <span class="highlight"
              >outshine other eco-friendly transportation options</span
            >
            like buses and carpools.
          </p>
          <p>
            This observation begged the question:
            <span class="highlight"
              >what if the environmental benefits of personal scooters could
              merge with the convenience of ridesharing?</span
            >
            With this concept in mind, we laid the groundwork for Scootly. We
            identified key features needed for an eco-friendly rideshare
            experience and initiated the design process.

            As the capstone project for the CS35L course, students were required
            to develop a full-stack web application using React as a recommended
            tech stack. However, my team and I aimed to extend the project's

          <h3>Backend</h3>
          <p>
            For our backend, we used Firebase to manage user authentication and
            securely store user data. We first configured Firebase into our
            project, created a Firebase project in the Firebase Console, and
            integrated the Firebase SDK into our app. We then
            <span class="highlight"
              >enabled various authentication methods, such as Email/Password
              and Google Sign-In, through Firebase’s Authentication

            We managed user sign-up, login, and logout using the Authentication
            API.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once users were authenticated,
            <span class="highlight"
              >we stored their information in Firebase Firestore.</span
            >
            We set up a Firestore database, creating a document for each user to
            record essential details like email, display name, user preferences

          <p>
            In the beginning of the course, our professor noted to a room of
            over 300 students that no capstone project has ever achieved
            commercial success. This revelation
            <span class="highlight"
              >ignited a drive in my team and me to become the first.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Even after the quarter ended and we earned a perfect score on our
            project,
            <span class="highlight"
              >we continued to refine Scootly with the goal of publishing it on
              the iOS App Store.</span
            >
            As we continue to put in the final touches, we’re excited to see how
            Scootly will resonate with users and contribute to a more convenient
            and sustainable future!
